song - What is love


Oh, I don't know why you're not there
I give you my love but you don't care
So what is right and what is wrong?
Give me a sign
I don't know why you're not there
I give you my love but you don't care
So what is right and what is wrong?
Give me a sign
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me no more
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me no more
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me no more
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me no more

 don't know, what can I do?
What else can I say, it's up to you
I know we're one, just me and you
I can't go on
Oh, I don't know, what can I do?
What else can I say, it's up to you
I know we are one, just me and you
I can't go on
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me no more
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me no more
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me no more
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me no more
